2024 Winter   Term
Assignment   1  2 -   Instructions
Introduction:   Policy   Brief (Presentation)
Both Assignment #1 and #2 are the   same; you   will   be   completing   the   same   assignment,   focused   on   two   different topics, allowing you to   learn from your experience   on the   first   one   to   improve   any   shortcomings for the second one.   Please   read the following   instructions carefully.
Assignment   Due   Dates
1.       Assignment #1 Due Date: Sunday February 25, by 11:59 PM
2.       Assignment   #2 Due   Date: Sunday   April   7, by   11:59 PM
Assignment Scenario
For   both   assignments   imagine that you   have   been   newly   hired   as a junior   policy analyst for   a   national agency   (i.e., a government department for   a specific   country).   Your   boss   has   tasked   you   with   giving   them   a   policy   brief   (effectively a summary of   policy options for   a   given   issue)   so that   they   can   make   a   coherent   argument   at   an   upcoming   meeting on the   issue. The   nature of the   policy   brief deliverable   in   this   case   is   a   presentation; imagine   you   arepresenting   your   findings   to   your   boss.
Assignment Objectives
The   objectives   of   these   assignments   areas   follows:
1.                            Gain   a general   understanding of the   nature   and causes   of   an   issue,   and   the   policy   options   in   addressing the   problem.
2.                            Develop   your   research   skills.
3.                            Develop your analytical   skills   in   assessing the   merits   of   two   (or   more)   policy   solutions.
4.                            Develop your   oral communication   and   presentation   skills.
Assignment Tasks
Completion of each assignment   involves the same three   steps.
1.       TopicSelection:
For   each assignment, as the above scenario   suggests, you   are   to   develop   a   policy   brief   on   one   of   the   following topics.   For   more   information about what a   policy   brief entails   (i.e., what   they   are,   what   they   include,   how to structure them, etc.),   please consult Appendix 1:   What is a   Policy Brief?   found   at   the      end of this   document.
Assignment   #1   Topics: Choose   one   of   the   following   topics
1.                              Food   insecurity   in   Sudan
2.                            Sustainable   Development Goal #4   (ensure   inclusive and   equitable   quality   education   and   promote   lifelong   learning opportunities for all)   in   Iran
3.                            Illegal   migration to   the   United   States
4.                            Opioid   crisis   in   Canada
Assignment   #2   Topics: Choose   one   of   the   following   topics
1.                            Homelessness   in   Hamilton,   Ontario
2.                            Urban   air   pollution   in   Bangladesh
3.                            Rare earth   mining   in the   Democratic   Republic   of the   Congo   (DRC)
4.                            Child   labour   in   Burkina   FasoFor each topic, a country or   region   has   been   identified   (if your   topic   has   an   identified   region,   you   should   choose a country from within that   region); this   is the country for   which   you   are   to   imagine   you   are   employed   by   (i.e., you are the junior   policy analyst for the   senior   government   minister   responsible for   that   issue   in that country). As such, you   need to   bethinking about   the   issue,   and   the   relevant   policy   options, from that   perspective. This does   not   mean you   need to think exclusively   about   the   issue   from   that   perspective,   but you   need to   keep your audience   (the senior government   minister   from   that   country)   in   mind.
2.         Research
With your topic   in   mind, conduct   research on the   issue,   in   both general terms   and   as   it   relates   to   your specific country or   region.   Next, conduct   research on   the types   of   policies   that   have   been   developed   and   implemented   both   in the   past and   elsewhere to address your   issue,   again   in   both general   terms   and   as   they   relate to your specific country   or   region.
As   research   is an   important   part of this assignment, you   are   required to   consult   at   least   three   academic   sources   (i.e.,   peer-reviewed   books,   peer-reviewed journal articles, government-issued   reports,   non-governmental   reports, etc.).    When you conduct   research,   it   is   important to   keep track   of the   sources         you   are   using, and to   provide appropriate citations   (references) to those   sources   in   your   final   product.
See Appendix 2: Research  Referencing at the end of   this   document   for   details   on   how   to   cite   references   properly.
3.       Deliverable: Recorded   Presentation
Develop a 5-8-minute   (recorded)   presentation that   includes the following:
•                               Introduction or   Executive   Summary:   provide   a   brief   overview   of the topic
•                               Background or   Summary:   more   detailed   discussion   of the   issue   and   several   of the   policy   solutions that   have   been   implemented   in the   pastor elsewhere
•                               Analysis: analyze the   policy   options
•                               Conclusion or   Recommendation:   recommend a   policy   solution   for   the   future   based   on   your   research and   analysis.
Please   note: Students who do   not adhere to   the   5–8-minute time   limit   will   be   subject   to   a   penalty   applied to their final assignment grade.
For   more   details about what should   be   included   in a   policy   brief,   see Appendix 1:   What is   a Policy   Brief?   found at the   end of   this   document.
Presentation Specifics
Your   presentation   is to take the form. of   both   slides and   audio   (i.e.,   a   recorded voiceover   of you “presenting” the slides) and should   be submitted   as   one file.   You   are   encouraged   to   use   Microsoft PowerPoint for your slides, which   is available for free to   all   McMaster   University   students   through   Microsoft   Office 365   (seehttps://office365.mcmaster.ca/). We also   recommend that you   use Zoom to   screen   record your   presentation so that you can   capture   both your   slides   and   audio   presentation   simultaneously. As with   Microsoft   Office 365, all   McMaster   University students   have   access to   Zoom   for   free   (seehttps://uts.mcmaster.ca/services/computers-printers-and-software/zoom/). While   you   may use other software, and   produce   presentations   in other formats   (i.e.,   .mov,   .mp4,   MacVideo,   Echo360,   YouTube, etc.),   it   is your   responsibility to ensure that your files work when   submitted   to   Avenue   to   Learn.
For guidance on   how to develop   (and   present) your   presentation, see Appendix 3: General   Tips   for   Presentations   located at the end of this   document.
Assignment Completion and Submission
Do   not wait for the   last   minute to start your assignment.   Each   assignment   is   worth   one   fifth   (20%)   of   your course grade   (40% combined), and   so you   should treat   it   as   such.   Get   started   early,   seek   assistance      when   needed   (i.e., visit assignment   preparation office   hours and/or   drop-in   office   hours –   see Avenue   to   Learn for details),   make an outline to guide   your thinking,   complete   a   draft   or   two,   get   feedback   from   friends,   peers, or family,   rehearse your   presentation several times   before submitting   a final   recorded   version, etc.
For   more on   how your assignment will   be evaluated,   please   see Appendix 4: Policy Brief   Assignment   Evaluation (Rubric)   located   at the end of this   document.
Submit your   presentation   as   a single file   (audio and slides   combined).   Please   include your   topic   number   (i.e.,   1-4) and   presentation   length   (in   minutes) in the submission window in   the Avenue   drop   box.
General Assignment Guidelines
Authenticity/Plagiarism   Detection
In this course we are   using the web-based   service   (Turnitin.com)   to   reveal   authenticity   and   ownership   of   student submitted work. Students will   be expected to   submit   their   work   electronically   either   directly   to Turnitin.com or via Avenue to   Learn   (A2L)   plagiarism detection   (a service   supported   by Turnitin.com)   so         it can   be checked for   academic   dishonesty.
Late Assignments


Your   presentation file   is to   be submitted   before the   due date/time and   must   be   submitted   to   the   relevant Avenue to   Learn   drop   box. Time   management and work-load   prioritization are   important   skills      that students develop over the course   of   their   academic   careers.   These   skills   are   the   sorts   of   things that   all employers demand   in the workplace, and   as   such,   we will   be   using   the   same   expectations   in   this   course. Your assignment   is expected to   be submitted   on the   date/time   outlined,   and   in   fairness   to   those      that   do submit their work on time,   late submissions   will   be   subject   to   a   late   penalty   often   percent   (10%)      per day   (i.e.,   per   24-hour   period following the due date/time), to   amaximum   of five   (5)   days,   after which   it will   not   be   marked.   Late   penalties apply   immediately after the deadline.   Please   note   that   in   the   real-world version of this task,a failure to   meet the   expectations/requirements of your   boss would   likely   result in you   being fired.
Request for   Relief for   Missed Academic Term Work:   McMaster Student Absence   Form. (MSAF)
In the case of a student   absence   (i.e.,   illness   or   other   extraordinary   circumstance)   that   affects   the   completion or submission of an   assignment,   please   ensure that   you   complete   the   online   MSAF   tool   and   follow‐up with   Heidi   (see   details   in the Course Outline). You will   still   be   required to   complete the   assignment. Students that   have their absence at the   due   date   of   an   assignment   excused   by   the Instructional Assistant   (Heidi),   irrespective of the   nature or   length of the   absence, will   have   their assignment   deadline extended   by five days to   Friday   March   1, at   11:59   PM   in the   case   of   Assignment   #1,   or   Friday April   12, at   11:59   PM   in the case of Assignment   #2.
Appendix   1: What is a   Policy   Brief?


IntroductionThe following document outlines,   in general terms, what   a   policy   brief   is, what   it   typically   does,   for   whom, and what   is   included.   For specific guidance on   what   to   do   for   a   policy   brief   assignment,   you   should   refer to the assignment   instructions given to you   by your   course   instructor.
In simple terms,a   policy   brief   is a summary of   a   problem,   created for   a   very   specific   audience,   and   with   a   set   of   recommendations to solve the   problem.   Most   of a   policy   brief   is dedicated to   summarizing   a   body of   knowledge,   but   it also aims to   persuade the audience about   a   course   of   action   (i.e.,   apolicy   to   implement). The   policy   brief   is typically short   and concise, as   it   aims to   provide   a   brief   overview   of the   key takeaways of the   problem,   rather than   an   in-depth   investigation.   Policy   briefs can   be written   documents, or oral communications   (presentations), and   of varying   lengths;   check with   your   instructor   about specifics for your   policy   brief task. The typical   policy   brief will take the following   form.:   executive      summary,   background   (i.e., summary of the   issue), analysis of   policy   options,   and   a   recommendation.
It   is   important to   note   here that   not   all   initiatives or solutions to   a   problem   are   necessarily   policies.   For   example, during the COVID-19   pandemic,   many   individuals and organizations   were working   towards limiting the spread of COVID-19.   However, while this   is   a   laudable   goal, this   would   not   be   considered   a   policy   because   it   is too   broad   and does   not   provide actionable steps that work towards   alleviating   (or solving) the   problem at   hand.   In contrast,   mask   mandates,   immunization   programs, and   social   distancing could   all   be considered   policies. The difference   is that these   initiatives are   specific   and   provide   actionable steps   (policies) which   work towards   limiting the spread   of   COVID-19   (goal).
General Guidelines
Here   are some general guidelines to   help you create   a   policy   brief   for   a   course,   but   of   course   pay   attention to any specific   instructions given to you   by your   Instructor.
1.       Policy   briefs are   t代 写ENVSOCTY 1HB3 C04 – Population, Cities and Development 2024 Winter Term Assignment 1 & 2Matlab
代做程序编程语言ypically   different   from   other   research   techniques   in   one   very   fundamentally
important way,the audience. A   policy   brief   is typically written for   one   person   (or   maybe   a   small   handful of   people); someone who   needs a concise   summary   of   an   issue,   and   a   recommendation   of      what options are available to them.   Often,   how   you   will   see these   types   of   projects   framed   is   in   the   form. of a scenario   (usually   based on   real-world   scenarios) where   a   senior   politician   (policymaker)   has   asked   a junior colleague   (you) to   research a   problem, summarize   it, examine the   policy   options,   and make a   recommendation for them to   implement.   In this way,   policy   briefs area   great   example   of   what   is called   problem-based   learning.
2.       You   may, or   may   not,   have the   option of   choosing   your   topic.   Typically,   we   do   not   have   a   choice   in   what we   research. Consider the scenario   discussed   above;   how   likely   is   it that a   senior   politician   (your   boss) will ask you to create abrief   on   a   topic   of   your   choosing?   However,   if   you   do   have   the choice of topics, then   begin with a general   idea,   and   then   use   preliminary   research   to   narrow   your   topic.   Make sure your topic   a) can   be   researched   effectively,   b)   interests   you,   and   c)   relates   to the   course   material/assigned topic.
3.       A   policy   brief generally   consists   of 4   parts:
a.       Executive Summary: typically,very short, this   simply   states what   the   problem   being
addressed   is, what the   underlying causes of the   problem are,   and the   recommended   policy   solution. This   is the ‘take   home’   message for the audience.   Helpful tip: while the   Executive      Summary appears first   in   the   policy   brief,   it   is often   easiest to create   this   section   last,   after      you   have completed everything else.
b.       Background/Review of   Literature/Summary of   Knowledge:   here you address the topic   in   more detail,   usually divided   into different sections,   and   discuss the   main   ideas.   Include discussion about the scope and severity   of   the   problem,   the   contributing   factors,   and   a review of what   policy actions   have   been taken   in the   past and   whether   they   are   working   (or   not).   Make sure to stay focused, everything you   discuss   should   relate   to   your   topic.
c.       Analysis of   Policy Options:   here you   provide   an   analysis   of   (at   least) two   (or   more)   policy
options. Consider that the   policymaker   (i.e., your   boss) will want you to   consider   a   number   of   strategies,   ranging from continuing with the status quo   (i.e.,   continuing with   the   current   policies), or   introducing a completely   new and   novel   policy,   or   possibly   even tweaking   policies   that   have   been applied   elsewhere. Your task   here   is to analyze the   pros   and   cons of   each   of   the   relevant   policy options   and   provide a summary of these   to   your   boss.
d.       Recommendation: a simple   statement   about what   you   recommend   should   be   done to
address the   problem   (not   necessarily solve   it), and why you think   it   is the   best   option going   forward. This   recommendation should   be   based on your   research, objective   discussion   of the   problem and analysis of the   existing   policy   options.


4.       Organize your thoughts.   Make a   concise   outline   of the   points   you   want   to   address   and   what   you   want to say. Structure your   policy   brief and   make   sure to   follow   a   logical   progression   of   ideas.
5.       Make sure   that   you   provide   supporting   evidence   for   your   statements.   For   example,   if   you   say that         global   population   is set to   reach   10   billion   by   mid-century, you   must   provide evidence to show   why   you   believe this to   be the case.
6.       Always   provide a   reference for any   of   your   sources   of   information. This   is   partly   about   giving   credit   where   it   is due   (i.e., acknowledging the   person(s) that   did the   research to collect   and   publish   the   information),   but   it   is also   about giving your statement an   element   of   credibility   (i.e.,   not   only   do   you   think this,   but you   have a credible source that   says the   same thing).   Furthermore,   passing   off   someone else’sidea, data, etc. as your   own,   is   a form   of   academic   dishonesty   (plagiarism).   To   properly   provide a   reference you should   include a citation   and   include   the   source   in   a   list   of references.
7.       Figures and   tables   are   often   very   important   supplementary   material.   In   fact,   many   policy   brief
assignments   may   require a certain   number of figures or   tables,   so   pay   attention   to   your requirements. Always   refer to your figure or table   in the text,   e.g., “Figure   1   illustrates the   growing importance of social   media as a   source   of   news   ...”   or   “The   majority   of   millennials get   their   news through social   media   rather than traditional   news sources   (Figure   1)”.   Each figure should   have   a caption   below stating what   it   shows and where   it   is taken from   (unless you   made   the   figure   yourself);   e.g., “Figure   1: Sources of   News, 2015   (Reuters, 2017)”   .   Note that   all   such   supplementary   materials are   referred to as either a figure   (i.e., graphs,   figures,   maps,   illustrations,   and   diagrams)   or   a   table.
8.       Avoid   use of first   person   (i.e.,   Ior we).   Keep the   policy   brief   impersonal   and   formal.
9.       Pay attention   to   grammar   and   pronunciation.   Do   not   use   contractions   such   as “don’t”   or   “can’t”   .   Avoid   extensive   use of the   passive voice.
10. The title of your   policy   brief should   reflect the   main   purpose   and objectives   of   your   work   and   include   some dimension of your final   recommendation – avoid titling   your   work “Policy   Brief”.   Adding   a   meaningful and   relevant title   may seem   like a small   and   irrelevant   matter   but   remember   this   is   typically the very first thing someone   reads, and first   impressions   matter.
Appendix 2:   Research    Referencing




Research      Referencing
In conducting your   research, you should consult your   lectures   and   the   course   textbook,   but   you   must   also consult   and   refer to at   least three   (3) additional   academic   sources   (i.e.,   peer-reviewed   books,   peer-   reviewed journal articles, government-issued   reports,   non-governmental   reports, etc.).
As   research   is an   important   component of this   assignment, you   need to   include a   slide   (or   two)   listing   all   of the sources and   references you   used   in conducting your   research   and   display these   slides   in   your   final   recording.   It   is crucial to   remember that when you consult   sources,   and   use this   information   in   your presentation, you   MUST   properly cite them.
We suggest you   use APA Style. for your sources/references/notes   slide(s).   For   more   on   APA   Style   referencing, see   https://libguides.mcmaster.ca/APA
Evidence
Make sure that you   provide supporting evidence for   your   statements.   For   example,   if you   say   that   the food   insecurity   in Yemenis   increasing, you   must   provide evidence to show that this   is true.   Evidence,   in this case, could   include a statistic,   or some   visual,   such   as   a   table,   graph,   map,   photo,   etc.   Always   provide   a   reference for any of your sources   of   information. This   is   partly   about   giving   credit   where   it   is   due   (i.e., acknowledging the   person(s) that   did the   research to collect and   publish the   information),   but   it   is   also   about giving your statement an element   of   credibility   (i.e.,   not   only   do you   think   this,   but   you   have   a   credible source that says the same thing).   Furthermore,   passing off   someone   else’sidea,   data,   etc.   as your own,   is a form. of academic   dishonesty   (plagiarism).   You   do   not need   to   say   anything   about   your   list of   sources/references/notes during your   presentation, other than to acknowledge   that they are there.
Appendix 3: General Tips for   Presentations


General Tips for   Presentations
•         When developing your   presentation slides,   it   is   important to   recognize that you   should   have   short   bullets   (not sentences of text) which   include a few   words to   prompt   what you   are   saying.
•          Pay attention to your grammar and   spelling,   these   matter.   Proofread   your   slides.
•         When developing your   presentation slides,   use some   of the   basic   animation tools   available   to   you   so   that   not all of the   bullets arrive at the   sametime. This   does   not   need   to   be   particularly   fancy   (as   that   can get distracting)   but   using the animation tools   allows   one   bullet to   appear   at   a   time   and   this   can be   helpful to the audience to follow what you are   talking   about.   You   can   do   the   same   with   images too.
•          Presentations are   partly a visual   medium, so visuals   matter.   Choose   a   good   presentation
template/background and think carefully about your slide   design   and   aesthetics.   Remember   that   this   is   intended to   be a   professional   presentation, so choose visuals   and   backgrounds   appropriately.
•         You   need to demonstrate you   have done   research.   Include a   slide   or two   at   the   end   which   lists   all   of   your   research sources   (including appropriate   lectures), and you should   provide   a   citation   after relevant text/images on your   slides.
•         Choose an   appropriate   presentation title; “   1HB3   Project”   is   not   really adequate. Try something   like   “   Food   Insecurity   in Yemen:   Policy Options’, this   is   much   more descriptive and   meaningful.
•         Choose appropriate titles for your slides;   “Slide   1” does   not   really   cut   it.   Try “   Food   Insecurity:   Past    Present   Context” for example.
•         When   recording your audio track over your slides,   avoid   reading.   Practice   what   you   want   to   say,   so   that you can speak freely and   knowledgeably   about the   presentation   slides   without   reading   your notes.
•          Practice your   presentation.
•         You   need to   adhere to the time   limits   (5-8   minutes).    Remember, this   is   a   policy   brief,   designed to   be   a   high-level summary   presented to your   boss who   likely does   not   have time to   hear   an   in-depth   analysis. As such, grade   penalties will   be applied for those   students   who   do   not   adhere   to   this time   limit. This   may   necessitate that you   record your   presentation a couple   of times, with   some   edits   to      your slides and   notes   in   between,   in   order to get   it just   right.

Assignment   Evaluation
This section acts as a   guide to   help   ensure   that   you   are   on   the   right   track.   Your   project   will   be   evaluated   based on the following   criteria:
1.         Content (50%)
•          Engaging   hook and   introductory overview of the topic
•         Summary of the scope and severity   of the   problem, the   underlying   causes   and   the   implications
•         Summary of the   recommended   policy solutions and the   actions that   have   been taken   in   the   past   and whether they are working   or   not
•          Recommended   policy solution and explanation/justification   of why you   have   chosen   this   policy
•          Demonstrated evidence of   research,   including explicit   linkage to   literature   (i.e.,   lectures,   textbook, academic sources,   etc.), and appropriate   use   of   citations,   list   of sources/references/notes, etc.
2.       Style.  Delivery   (25%)
•         Timing/length   (5-8   mins)
•         Appropriate   use of transitions, clarity of speech, comfort   in   public   speaking,   volume    pace   of   speech, evidence of   rehearsal,   etc.
•          Effective   presentation skills that demonstrate speaking without   reading, familiarity   with   content,   etc.
3.       Presentation Aesthetics (25%)
•         Organization of slides   (i.e., clarity,   logical ordering, transitions   between   slides,   etc.)
•         Aesthetics of slides,   creativity, slide   design,   utility of   photos,   maps,   tables/charts,   etc.)
•         Clarity of slides   (i.e., font sizes,   readability,   balance of text   and   images,   etc.)
•          Presentation   polish   (i.e.,   lack of typos, etc.)
